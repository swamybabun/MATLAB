### variables

- Variable names should start with a letter.
- Contain only letters, numbers and underscore.
- Variable names are case sensitive.


- Create row vector

 x = [1,2,3,4,5]

 - Create column vector

 y = [1;3;4;5;6;8]

- Labelling x and y axis.

xlabel() and ylabel() function

title() for naming the plot.

- creating uniformed spaced Vectors

 - with a given spacing use : operator

 10:5:50  ==> This creates a vector from 10 to 50 with spacing as 5 ...10,15,20,25...50

 - For number of elements use linspace function.

- Element wise Operators  ==> .* , ./ , .^ .

+ and -  can be used as it is.

These are useful for applying a calculation over all elements in a vector.

- Colouring plot

m:s ===> Magenta color dotted line with square MarkerS  <br>
g--* ==> Green color dashed line with star markers <br>
r- ==> red solid line with no markers
