MATLAB Tutorial

This tutorial is for beginners who wants to learn MATLAB. Let's begin with commands

##### Entering Commands
- You can execute commands by entering them in the command window after the MATLAB prompt (>>) and pressing the Enter key.
- Unless otherwise specified, MATLAB stores calculations in a variable named **ans**.
- The equals sign (=) in MATLAB is the assignment operator, meaning that the expression on the right of the equals sign is assigned to the variable on the left. So, when you enter x = 3+4, MATLAB first evaluates 3+4 and then assigns the result (7) to the variable x.
- Notice that the Workspace window (on the right) shows all the variables currently in the workspace.
- Adding a semicolon to the end of a command will suppress the output, though the command will still be executed, as you can see in the Workspace. When you enter a command without a semicolon at the end, MATLAB displays the result in the command window.
- You can recall previous commands by pressing the Up arrow key on your keyboard. Note that the Command Window must be the active window for this to work.
- When you enter just a variable name at the command prompt, MATLAB returns the current value of that variable.


Workspace hints:

- Notice that the Workspace window (on the right) shows all the variables currently in the workspace.

##### Storing Data in Variables

- You can name your MATLAB variables anything you'd like as long as they start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores **_**.

    3sq = 9

    Error: Invalid expression. Check for missing multiplication operator, missing or unbalanced delimiters, or other syntax error. To construct matrices, use brackets instead of
    parentheses.

    Did you mean: sq = 9 ?
